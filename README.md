--------------

For a long time, there was no resource where you could post general rules or helper functions and get some new ideas. This repository is intended to share experiences in writing rules in the CxQL language.

All the rules in it are general in nature, extend the capabilities of the system, and can be applied to any projects, without being tied to specifics. Also, you can modify the rules to suit the specifics of your applications by adding and expanding the list of variable names, libraries, and other features used.

## Repository Structure
The structure is divided by languages, as in the tool itself. Almost every line in the rules will be commented on for a better understanding of what is happening and how the CxQL language works.
